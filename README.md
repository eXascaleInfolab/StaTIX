- [xmeasures](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/xmeasures)  - Extrinsic clustering measures evaluation for the multi-resolution clustering with overlaps (covers): F1_gm for overlapping multi-resolution clusterings with possible unequal node base and standard NMI for non-overlapping clustering on a single resolution.
- [GenConvNMI](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/GenConvNMI) - Overlapping NMI evaluation that is (unlike `onmi`) compatible with the original NMI and suitable for both overlapping and multi resolution (hierarchical) clusterings.
